# 🚂 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - COMPLETE SETUP

## ✅ ALREADY PUSHED TO GIT!

All your code is already in git branch: `cursor/create-paper-trading-crypto-bot-3fea`

Files added:
- ✅ `production-paper-bot.js` - Paper trading bot
- ✅ `educational-bot-integration.js` - Stats reporter  
- ✅ `simple-paper-bot.js` - Learning bot
- ✅ `Procfile` - Railway process configuration
- ✅ `package.json` - Updated with ccxt + ws

---

## 🚀 RAILWAY SETUP (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Merge Your Branch (or Deploy from Branch)

**Option A: Deploy from your current branch**
- Railway will auto-detect your branch
- Just redeploy from Railway dashboard

**Option B: Merge to main first**
```bash
# You can do this in Railway's GitHub integration
# Or ask me to merge for you
```

---

### Step 2: Environment Variables in Railway

Go to your Railway project → **Variables** tab

#### 🔒 **KEEP YOUR EXISTING VARIABLES** (Don't touch these!):
```
TWITTER_USERNAME=your_twitter_username
TWITTER_PASSWORD=your_twitter_password  
TWITTER_EMAIL=your_email
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY=...
# ... all other existing vars
```

#### 🆕 **ADD THESE NEW VARIABLES** (Optional for paper bot):

**IMPORTANT:** These are **OPTIONAL**! The paper bot can work WITHOUT API keys using public Binance data.

```
# Optional: Only if you want to use authenticated Binance endpoints
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key_here
BINANCE_SECRET=your_binance_secret_here

# Alternative: Bybit (if you prefer Bybit over Binance)
# BYBIT_API_KEY=your_bybit_api_key_here  
# BYBIT_SECRET=your_bybit_secret_here
```

**How to get Binance API keys (if you want them):**
1. Go to Binance.com → Login
2. Profile → API Management
3. Create API Key
4. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Set permissions to **READ ONLY** (no trading, no withdrawals!)
5. Copy API Key and Secret to Railway variables

**But again: NOT REQUIRED!** The bot reads public market data by default.

---

### Step 3: Enable Worker Process in Railway

Railway needs to run TWO processes:
1. **web** process: Your educational bot (index.js)
2. **worker** process: Paper trading bot (production-paper-bot.js)

The `Procfile` I created tells Railway to do this automatically!

#### In Railway Dashboard:

1. Go to your project
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Look for **Processes** or **Deployments**
4. You should see:
   - ✅ `web: node index.js` (your educational bot)
   - ✅ `worker: node production-paper-bot.js` (paper trading bot)

5. Make sure BOTH are **enabled** ✅

If you don't see the worker process:
- Click **"Add Process"**
- Type: `worker`
- Command: `node production-paper-bot.js`
- Click **Save**

---

### Step 4: Deploy / Redeploy

1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Railway
2. Click **"Deploy"** or it auto-deploys on git push
3. Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

---

### Step 5: Monitor Both Bots (IMPORTANT!)

Railway will show logs for BOTH processes:

#### **View Educational Bot Logs (web process):**
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project
2. Select **"web"** process
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. You'll see your Twitter bot posting as usual ✅

#### **View Paper Trading Bot Logs (worker process):**
1. Railway Dashboard → Your Project  
2. Select **"worker"** process
3. Click **"Logs"** tab
4. You'll see:
   ```
   🚀 INITIALIZING PRODUCTION PAPER TRADING BOT
   ✅ Connected to BINANCE
   📊 BTC/USDT Current Price: $95,234.56
   💰 Paper Trading Balance: $10,000
   📈 Strategy: MA(7/25) + RSI(14)
   ✅ WebSocket connected - LIVE MARKET DATA
   ```

### Educational Bot Logs (web):

Same as before - Twitter posting, market analysis, etc.

---

## 🎯 VERIFY IT'S WORKING

### Check 1: Both Processes Running
Railway Dashboard → you should see:
- ✅ **web** process: Running (green dot)
- ✅ **worker** process: Running (green dot)

### Check 2: Paper Bot Connected
Worker logs should show:
```
✅ Connected to BINANCE
✅ WebSocket connected - LIVE MARKET DATA
```

### Check 3: Educational Bot Still Working
Web logs should show Twitter posts as usual

### Check 4: Stats File Created
After first candle closes (5 minutes), the bot creates `trading_stats.json`
(You won't see this file in Railway, but it exists in the container)

---

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: Worker process not starting

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Make sure `Procfile` exists in your git repo
3. Verify `production-paper-bot.js` is in your repo
4. Check that `ccxt` and `ws` are in package.json dependencies

### Problem: "Cannot find module 'ccxt'"

**Solution:**
1. Check package.json has `"ccxt": "^4.5.7"`
2. Railway should auto-install on deploy
3. Try redeploying

### Problem: "WebSocket connection failed"

**Solution:**
1. This is normal if Binance is temporarily down
2. Bot will auto-reconnect every 5 seconds
3. Check Binance status: https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement

### Problem: Educational bot stopped working

**Solution:**
1. Check web process logs for errors
2. Paper bot runs separately - shouldn't affect educational bot
3. If needed, disable worker process temporarily
4. Your educational bot code is UNTOUCHED, so it should work as before

---

## 🔄 NEXT STEPS AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### Day 1: Monitor Initial Run
- Watch worker logs for first 24 hours
- Check if paper bot connects successfully
- Verify no crashes

### Week 1: Collect Data
- Let paper bot run for 7 days
- Wait for at least 5-10 trades
- Don't integrate with educational bot yet

### Week 2: Verify Stats
- Check if trades make sense
- Manually verify P&L calculations
- See if win rate is realistic

### Week 3: Integrate with Educational Bot
- If paper bot is stable, we'll add stats reporter to index.js
- Educational bot will start posting paper trading results
- Real, honest, transparent trading updates!
